        <h3>about me</h3>

        <p>I am a sucker for clean, functional websites. I love bright colors and anything with a playful feel. I work primarily as a front-end developer but I come from a design background and adore utilizing all of my skills to build beautiful web applications.</p>
        <p>Since 2011 I have worked as a web developer for USA Today. I participated in the site's 2012 re-launch and have since moved on to the interactives team. In addition, I am the Co-founder and lead front-end designer and developer for the DC Startup, Flashband; a company that helps musicians meet and play music. </p>

        <p>In my spare time, I am an avid hobby collector. While rock climbing is my current obsession, I have dabbled in fencing, figure skating, contra dancing, and automotive repair. I've been a Star Wars geek since I was 11 and a Trekkie (Trekker?) even longer. Don't talk to me about Babylon 5, but why have you never watched Farscape? </p>
        <p>I am a huge fan of chips and salsa. I've recently accepted that olives aren't the worst food in the world, but don't put them on my pizza.</p>
