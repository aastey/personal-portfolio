    <h2 class="right-party">Ashley Houghton</h2>

    <p class="right-party-sub">Officiant</p>

     <p class="paragraph-text party">It was a Mika concert on October 16th,
     2009 that solidified the friendship between Ashley and Amanda. The two drove up to New
     York City, saw the concert and drove back all in one night. It was an evening
     full of squeals, ukulele sing-alongs and intense bonding.</p>

     <p class="paragraph-text party">When Caleb came into the picture, he
     was somewhat of a complicatition to the completely merged lives of Ashley and
     Amanda. However his charm and persistance won Ashley over and the two developed a
     close relationship based on post-party brunches and political
     debates.</p>

     <p class="paragraph-text party">Ashley has been an enormous part of the
     relationship between Caleb and Amanda. She has been a patient ear, an encouraging
     voice and a mediator of crazy behavior. Her selflessness and enthusiasm for life
     make her Caleb and Amanda's favorite right-hand-lady and the perfect choice for
     their officiant.</p>

    <h3 class="right-party">Kate Davenport</h3>
    <p class="right-party-sub">Maid of Honor</p>
    <p class="paragraph-text party">Kate is Amanda's older and wiser
    sister. She is her best friend and her "Barbie." Kate and Amanda have
    been loving, fighting, crying and laughing for 28 years and they never
    plan to stop.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">Thanks to Kate, Amanda is a Trekkie.
    Thanks to Kate, Amanda loves Shakespeare. Thanks to Kate, Amanda is
    forever obsessed with Frank from "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers."
    Thanks to Kate, Amanda has the best brother-in-law and niece a girl
    could ask for.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">Kate will undoubtedly be the greatest
    maid of honor ever. She is fabulous at party planning and creating
    unique and personalized games. Her own wedding continues to be one of
    Amanda's biggest inspirations in terms of planning.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">If Amanda smashes cake in Caleb's face
    on the big day, Kate will disown her forever.</p>

    <h2 class="right-party">Evan Ignatz</h2>

    <p class="right-party-sub">Best Man</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">It isn't surprising that the love
    between Caleb and Evan originated on Craigslist. The two first found
    each other when Evan's band advertised their need for a guitar player.
    Caleb auditioned, Caleb joined the band, Caleb found his soulmate.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">Caleb and Evan share a love of music
    and a love of hockey. They feed off each other's energy and are always
    a sight to behold whether on stage, on the ice or merely at a party.
    They have worked together on several projects - anyone out there
    remember 'The Cortland Fiasco?' - and they are always learning from one
    another as they navigate through their various interests.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">As Ashley is Amanda's platonic "other
    half," so is Evan to Caleb. Caleb and Amanda do not approve of these
    important people no longer living down the street.</p>

     <h2 class="right-party">Emily Lilja</h2>

    <p class="right-party-sub">Bridesmaid</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">Amanda and Emily are highschool friends
    who weren't actually friends in highschool. They started hanging out
    through mutual friends in college and really bonded one night at an
    Adam's Morgan hooka bar. A few weeks later they took a trip to
    Williamsburg, VA and their friendship was cemented through hoop and
    stick games.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">One of the strongest bonds in their
    friendship comes from a shared obsession with all things nerdy. Amanda
    and Emily frequently geek out over Doctor Who and Battlestar Galactica.
    They both enjoy halloween and themed parties and they once had a
    wonderful Rocky Horror Picture Show midnight adventure.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">Someday Amanda and Emily will attend a
    Comicon together... someday.</p>

    <h2 class="right-party">Greg Thomson</h2>

     <p class="right-party-sub">Bridesman</p>

     <p class="paragraph-text party">Greg and Amanda met through the
     infamous Wine Night Crew over 5 years ago. Though they don't share a
     common outlook on life (Amanda strives to be awesome while Greg
     embodies all things dastardly), they find common ground in Sci-fi,
     Rennfests, Fencing and chatting online throughout the work day.</p>

     <p class="paragraph-text party">A few years ago, Amanda introduced Greg
     to his wife, Heather. Heather was a coworker of Amanda's who shared
     Greg's love of learning, nerdy-ness, and sarcastic wit. Unfortunately
     Heather is no longer with us, but Greg has graciously agreed to
     represent both his fabulous self and the memory of a lost friend. One
     might view him as the ULTRA Bridesman, given all of the love and
     memories he is bringing to the wedding party.</p>

    <h2 class="right-party">Sultana Khan</h2>

    <p class="right-party-sub">Bridesmaid</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">Sultana holds the title of "Amanda's
    oldest friend" as the two have been a part of each other's lives since
    the 6th grade. After a somewhat scandalous ski trip (don't let kids
    play truth or dare on a school bus) the two realized they were friends
    for life and have kept in touch despite frequent separations (Stop
    going to Vermont, dangit!)</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">There are rumors that Sultana and
    Amanda made talk show parodies on their parents' video cameras in the
    90s, but all evidence is missing. If you come across any of this
    footage, please let us know immediately as it will be quite valuable
    when Sultana emerges as the most famous blogger/writer/gardener/cook of
                  all time.</p>

    <h2 class="right-party">Claire Sale</h2>

    <p class="right-party-sub">Bridesmaid</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">Claire and Amanda have known each other
    since middleschool, but their friendship reached a new level in their
    twenties. Frequent visits to the Black Cat and the revival of Wine
    night ensured that these ladies saw each other several times a week.
    Amanda spent many a lazy weeknight in the apartment Claire shared with
    her now-husband, Kevin and she was honored to be a part of their
    beautiful wedding in Antigua a few years ago.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">Claire is making the loooonnng journey
    from Saudia Arabia to be in this wedding as she is currently living at
    Kaust University with Kevin and their son, Jordan. Caleb and Amanda are
    extremely touched by her willingness to make this trek and they plan to
    make it worthwhile by showering her with bacon and wine.</p>

    <h2 class="right-party">Allison Mathis</h2>

     <p class="right-party-sub">Bridesmaid</p>

     <p class="paragraph-text party">Allison and Amanda probably met
     backstage at a Walt Whitman High School production of "Hello Dolly". To
     be honest, Amanda isn't sure what play they worked on first, but she
     knows that her high school experience was highly influenced by her
     stage managing adventures with Ms. Mathis. They both loved the theater
     and found they had similar taste in movies, tv, books and men (at least
     the men that walked the halls of Whitman).</p>

     <p class="paragraph-text party">Despite living in Philadelphia, Allison
     is a frequent part of Amanda and Caleb's adventures. She even made the
     drive down to be at their engagement on a random Sunday evening! She is
     easily one of the best contra dancers Amanda has come across and Amanda
     is somewhat hopeful of a rock climbing demonstration at the
     reception.</p>

    <h2 class="right-party">Jessica Pollak</h2>

    <p class="right-party-sub">Bridesmaid</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">Jessica Pollak and Amanda Kirby have
    gone through countless adventures over the years. They met in middle
    school and have always been a ridiculously silly pair. They are the
    worst (no really, the worst) at sleepovers as they will keep you up
    with their giggling and blanket stealing. Just ask fellow bridesmaid,
    Sultana.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">When Jessica and Amanda went their
    separate ways for college they kept in touch via snail mail. They would
    decorate envelopes and doodle in the margins. Amanda has kept all of
    these notes and loves leafing through them when she is feeling
    sentimental. Jessica, a talented artist, always made the most beautiful
    and creative cards.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">Jessica recently married her long time
    boyfriend, Robin in September of 2013. Amanda was a bridesmaid at this
    event and was blown away by how beautiful and FUN the entire event was.
    She might be stealing an idea or two... mwuhahahahahaa</p>

    <h2 class="right-party">William Cody</h2>

    <p class="right-party-sub">Groomsman</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">Caleb met Cody through the first ever
    Flashband event and they have played music together ever since. Cody is
    the lead rapper of "All the Best Kids." He is also a talented lyricist
    and singer and continually impresses with his ambition and
    creativity.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">There are few people Caleb and Amanda
    enjoy hanging out with more. Cody can spend an afternoon playing music
    with Caleb and an evening gushing over Battlestar Galactica with
    Amanda. Caleb and Amanda share pretty much everything with him (which
    may have led to an embarassing ATBK song or two...) and he is often
    their first call when they are looking for a fun night out.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">Cody is in danger of becoming an Astey
    himself as Caleb's mom, Colleen, has fallen desperately in love with
    him.</p>
    
</div>
<div class="party-div" id="mckenzie-box">
    <p class="close-div">Close</p>
    <h2 class="right-party">Mckenzie Astey</h2>

    <p class="right-party-sub">Groomsmaid</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">Like most siblings, Caleb and Mckenzie
    didn't get along too well in their younger years. But thanks to a dose
    of maturity and some extremely creative punishments by their parents
    (Ok kids... go to EACH OTHER'S room!) these two have become incredibly
    close.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">Mckenzie was the first person to
    predict the outcome of Caleb and Amanda's relationship. Her approval
    was very important to the couple and they were relieved when none of
    Amanda's jewelry went missing on their first home visit - an infamous
    sign of doom in the Astey household.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">Keep your eyes on Mckenzie during the
    wedding reception. That girl can moooove.</p>

    <p class="close-div">Close</p>
    <h2 class="right-party">Eric Johnson</h2>

    <p class="right-party-sub">Groomsman</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">One day, Amanda received an email from
    Caleb asking, "How much would someone have to pay you to break up with
    me?" Amanda romantically replied,</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">"I dunno. $15.34"</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">The next day Eric showed up at the
    apartment with $15.34 worth of candy. So, in all fairness, Eric owns
    Amanda fair and square. We're lucky he's letting this wedding take
    place.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">Eric was Caleb's officemate at Boeing
    and the two developed a close relationship in their time together.
    Caleb was consistently impressed by Eric's desire to learn. One week
    Eric would talk about gardening, the next week Parkour... there was
    always something new. He has also become Caleb and Amanda's favorite
    theater buddy as he is a great appreciator of the arts.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">We just hope he doesn't raise any
    objections at the wedding...</p>

<div class="party-div" id="kt-box">
    <p class="close-div">Close</p>
    <h2 class="right-party">Kristine Teets</h2>

    <p class="right-party-sub">Groomsmaid</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">When Caleb and Kristine met several
    years ago they instantly bonded over their love of music. They have
    worked together in several bands, most recently "All the Best Kids,'
    and they still love an evening of busking out in Dupont.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">Kristine is often considered a mentor
    of the friend group as she is always willing to listen and lend advice
    to a party in need. She is also the only one who can keep a room full
    of rowdy musicians in line. And we can't even mention her Christmas
    cards without tearing up...</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">However, this reputation doesn't take
    into account KT's infamous parties or her rockstar persona on the
    stage. Nor does it embody her dancing talents or ability to make a mean
    quiche. Kristine is pretty much a one stop shop for music, fun, and
    deliciousness.</p>

    <h2 class="right-party">Jared McLemore</h2>

    <p class="right-party-sub">Groomsman</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">Caleb and Jared lived together for
    years before Amanda came into the picture. Together the roommates
    dominated the Arlington social scene with their good looks and
    ridiculous behavior. Any night they went out on the town turned into an
    outrageous adventure.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">Jared is, without a doubt, the best
    story teller that Caleb and Amanda have come across. He can make a
    night watching cheesy chick flicks sound like the most fun a person can
    have. And, let's be honest, if you're watching chick flicks with Jared,
    you're probably having a stellar time.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">When Caleb and Amanda moved in together
    they had some trouble adjusting to their Jared-less abode. Returning
    home after a late night at the bars is never as much fun without a
    Jared dance party.</p>

    know who your favorite Disney princess is. She is partial to
    Cinderella, but she respects your decisions.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">Gwen was born about 2 weeks into Caleb
    and Amanda's relationship, so the couple never has any trouble
    remembering her birthday. It has been a delight watching her grow over
    the years and learn to walk, talk, sing, and adorably refer to Caleb as
    "Caib.""</p>

    <p class="paragraph-text party">Gwen is an experienced flower girl as
    she held the position once before for her Aunt Tiffany in 2012.</p>
