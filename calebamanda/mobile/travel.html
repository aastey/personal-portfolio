<p class="paragraph-text">We have reserved a block of rooms at the <a href= "http://www.bethesdacourtwashdc.com/" target= "_blank">Bethesda Court Hotel</a> in Bethesda MD. It is walking distance to the Metro and it is a pick-up location for the wedding shuttle (a good idea if you're planning to drink).</p>


    <p class="paragraph-text">The rate is $99/night for a room with a king bed or two double beds. To reserve call <span class="bold-text">(301) 656-2100</span>. Group Code is <span class="bold-text">KIRB</span> or just <span class="bold-text">Kirby/Astey Wedding</span></p>

    <p class="paragraph-text ">We highly recommend staying at Bethesda Court due to its central location and the large discount we've received. However, if you would like to stay somewhere else that weekend, we are happy to give recommendations!</p>

    <h1 class="page-title">Shuttle Bus</h1>

    <p class="paragraph-text ">We will be running a shuttle bus throughout the night to help guests get to and from the wedding. Instructions coming soon!</p><a href="" target="_blank"></a>
