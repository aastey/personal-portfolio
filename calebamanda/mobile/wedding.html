     <h1 class="page-title">Glen Echo Park</h1>

    <p class="paragraph-text wedding">Glen Echo Park is a former amusement park that has been repurposed as a local arts center. It is located on the edge of Potomac, Maryland and has always been one of Amanda's favorite locations in the DC area. The roller coasters and carnival games are gone, but a beautiful space remains. Perhaps its most appealing feature is the beautiful Dentzel carousel, which guests will be able to ride during the cocktail hour!</p>
    
    <h1 class="page-title">Ceremony</h1>

    <p class="paragraph-text wedding">The wedding ceremony will be held in the Cuddle-Up Pavilion - a covered outdoor space roughly 200 feet from the reception area. It is a cheerful and bright little structure that will bring a fun feel to the event.</p>

    <h1 class="page-title">Reception</h1>

    <p class="paragraph-text wedding">When it comes time to party, guests can easily saunter over to the old bumper-car pavilion for the reception. This covered area is a beautiful space with a wooden stage, removable walls (available in case of rain) and year-round christmas lights. Unfortunately all bumper cars have been removed, but Amanda prefers dance floors to sore necks and crushed fingers .</p>
