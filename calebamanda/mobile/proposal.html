<p class="paragraph-text">When Amanda woke up the morning of
     Sunday, March 3rd, she didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. The day
     was pre-planned - Caleb would record with "All the Best Kids" in the
     basement while Amanda would prepare the house for a potluck that evening.
     It was decidedly un-extraordinary.</p>

     <p class="paragraph-text">However, when it came time for the
     potluck... no one showed up. Caleb convinced a confused Amanda to relax
     with him on the couch. She obliged and leaned her head on his chest.
     "Why... is your heart beating so fast?" she asked. Caleb had no
     explanation, but Amanda thought nothing of it.</p>

     <p class="paragraph-text">Suddenly, Caleb popped up from the
     couch. He walked to the back of the house with great purpose. Amanda
     followed as her questions of "What are you doing?" were answered with
     silence. After some fumbling with the back door, Caleb and Amanda stepped
     onto their porch and it all became clear. Roughly 40 of their closest
     friends were waiting with music, candles and a sign that read "Will you
     Marry Me?"</p>
