    <h1 class="webpage-title">About Caleb and Amanda</h1>
<div class="text-container">
    <p class="paragraph-text">There's only one place to go when you're looking
      for something awesome these days... the internet! In December, 2009 Caleb and
      Amanda found each other on the oh-so-popular website, OKCupid. Amanda was
      attracted to Caleb's disregard for the profile questions while Caleb was
      attracted to Amanda's bold internet persona.</p>

      <p class="paragraph-text">The living arrangements were a little awkward "Oh,
      you live in that apartment building? I live in this apartment building...
      across the street..." but the couple found that living so close to each other
      worked in their favor. A few dates and a snowpocalypse later, the pair was
      inseparable. They walked, ran, and even rollerbladed to each other's abodes
      to spend time with their exciting new partners.</p>

      <p class="paragraph-text">In their time together Caleb and Amanda discovered
      their mutual love of intelligent sci-fi, random weeknight adventures, and
      kittens (especially those named Mayhem). They did not agree on Joss Whedon
      and Hockey, but they learned to live with that. They found that they were
      excellent travel partners and in the past few years they have explored New
      York City, Pittsburgh, Williamsburg, San Francisco, London, Cambridge,
      Bucharest, Rome, Florence, and Venice.</p>

      <p class="paragraph-text">Over the past few years Caleb and Amanda have
      combined their acquaintances and created the best friend group anyone could
      imagine. They never would have gotten here without the continued love and
      support from wine night, potlucks, bands, hockey teams, community theater,
      fencing and flashband. And, of course, they couldn't be more grateful for
      their close-knit, phenomenal families.</p>

      <p class="paragraph-text">Caleb and Amanda can't wait to take this next step
      in their relationship and they look forward to a lifetime of their infamous
      "magic tricks" and late night debates on the living room couch.</p>
