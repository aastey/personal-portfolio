                        <p class="paragraph-text">There's only one place to go when you're looking
                        for something awesome these days... the internet! In December, 2009 Caleb and
                        Amanda found each other on the oh-so-popular website, OKCupid. Amanda was
                        attracted to Caleb's disregard for the profile questions while Caleb was
                        attracted to Amanda's bold internet persona.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-text">The living arrangements were a little awkward "Oh,
                        you live in that apartment building? I live in this apartment building...
                        across the street..." but the couple found that living so close to each other
                        worked in their favor. A few dates and a snowpocalypse later, the pair was
                        inseparable. They walked, ran, and even rollerbladed to each other's abodes
                        to spend time with their exciting new partners.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-text">In their time together Caleb and Amanda discovered
                        their mutual love of intelligent sci-fi, random weeknight adventures, and
                        kittens (especially those named Mayhem). They did not agree on Joss Whedon
                        and Hockey, but they learned to live with that. They found that they were
                        excellent travel partners and in the past few years they have explored New
                        York City, Pittsburgh, Williamsburg, San Francisco, London, Cambridge,
                        Bucharest, Rome, Florence, and Venice.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-text">Over the past few years Caleb and Amanda have
                        combined their acquaintances and created the best friend group anyone could
                        imagine. They never would have gotten here without the continued love and
                        support from wine night, potlucks, bands, hockey teams, community theater,
                        fencing and flashband. And, of course, they couldn't be more grateful for
                        their close-knit, phenomenal families.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-text">Caleb and Amanda can't wait to take this next step
                        in their relationship and they look forward to a lifetime of their infamous
                        "magic tricks" and late night debates on the living room couch.</p>

                <p class="paragraph-text">When Amanda woke up the morning of
                  Sunday, March 3rd, she didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. The day
                  was pre-planned - Caleb would record with "All the Best Kids" in the
                  basement while Amanda would prepare the house for a potluck that evening.
                  It was decidedly un-extraordinary.</p>

                  <p class="paragraph-text">However, when it came time for the
                  potluck... no one showed up. Caleb convinced a confused Amanda to relax
                  with him on the couch. She obliged and leaned her head on his chest.
                  "Why... is your heart beating so fast?" she asked. Caleb had no
                  explanation, but Amanda thought nothing of it.</p>

                  <p class="paragraph-text">Suddenly, Caleb popped up from the
                  couch. He walked to the back of the house with great purpose. Amanda
                  followed as her questions of "What are you doing?" were answered with
                  silence. After some fumbling with the back door, Caleb and Amanda stepped
                  onto their porch and it all became clear. Roughly 40 of their closest
                  friends were waiting with music, candles and a sign that read "Will you
                  Marry Me?"</p>

                        park that has been repurposed as a local arts center. It is located on
                        the edge of Potomac, Maryland and has always been one of Amanda's
                        favorite locations in the DC area. The roller coasters and carnival games
                        are gone, but a beautiful space remains. Perhaps its most appealing
                        feature is the beautiful Dentzel carousel, which guests will be able to
                        ride during the cocktail hour!</p>

                        walls (available in case of rain) and year-round christmas lights.
                        Unfortunately all bumper cars have been removed, but Amanda prefers dance

                  2009 that solidified the friendship between Ashley and Amanda. The two drove up to New
                  York City, saw the concert and drove back all in one night. It was an evening
                  full of squeals, ukulele sing-alongs and intense bonding.</p>

                  <p class="paragraph-text party">When Caleb came into the picture, he
                  was somewhat of a complicatition to the completely merged lives of Ashley and
                  Amanda. However his charm and persistance won Ashley over and the two developed a
                  close relationship based on post-party brunches and political
                  debates.</p>

                  <p class="paragraph-text party">Ashley has been an enormous part of the
                  relationship between Caleb and Amanda. She has been a patient ear, an encouraging
                  voice and a mediator of crazy behavior. Her selflessness and enthusiasm for life
                  make her Caleb and Amanda's favorite right-hand-lady and the perfect choice for
                  their officiant.</p>

                  between Caleb and Evan originated on Craigslist. The two first found
                  each other when Evan's band advertised their need for a guitar player.
                  Caleb auditioned, Caleb joined the band, Caleb found his soulmate.</p>

                  <p class="paragraph-text party">Caleb and Evan share a love of music
                  and a love of hockey. They feed off each other's energy and are always
                  a sight to behold whether on stage, on the ice or merely at a party.
                  They have worked together on several projects - anyone out there
                  remember 'The Cortland Fiasco?' - and they are always learning from one
                  another as they navigate through their various interests.</p>

                  <p class="paragraph-text party">As Ashley is Amanda's platonic "other

                  who weren't actually friends in highschool. They started hanging out
                  through mutual friends in college and really bonded one night at an
                  Adam's Morgan hooka bar. A few weeks later they took a trip to
                  Williamsburg, VA and their friendship was cemented through hoop and

                  <p class="paragraph-text party">One of the strongest bonds in their
                  friendship comes from a shared obsession with all things nerdy. Amanda
                  and Emily frequently geek out over Doctor Who and Battlestar Galactica.
                  They both enjoy halloween and themed parties and they once had a

                  <p class="paragraph-text party">A few years ago, Amanda introduced Greg
                  to his wife, Heather. Heather was a coworker of Amanda's who shared
                  Greg's love of learning, nerdy-ness, and sarcastic wit. Unfortunately
                  Heather is no longer with us, but Greg has graciously agreed to
                  represent both his fabulous self and the memory of a lost friend. One

                  play truth or dare on a school bus) the two realized they were friends

                  night ensured that these ladies saw each other several times a week.
                  Amanda spent many a lazy weeknight in the apartment Claire shared with

                  backstage at a Walt Whitman High School production of "Hello Dolly". To
                  be honest, Amanda isn't sure what play they worked on first, but she
                  knows that her high school experience was highly influenced by her
                  stage managing adventures with Ms. Mathis. They both loved the theater
                  and found they had similar taste in movies, tv, books and men (at least

                  separate ways for college they kept in touch via snail mail. They would
                  decorate envelopes and doodle in the margins. Amanda has kept all of
                  these notes and loves leafing through them when she is feeling
                  sentimental. Jessica, a talented artist, always made the most beautiful

                  <p class="paragraph-text party">Jessica recently married her long time

                  didn't get along too well in their younger years. But thanks to a dose
                  of maturity and some extremely creative punishments by their parents
                  (Ok kids... go to EACH OTHER'S room!) these two have become incredibly
                  close.</p>

                  <p class="paragraph-text party">Mckenzie was the first person to
                  predict the outcome of Caleb and Amanda's relationship. Her approval
                  was very important to the couple and they were relieved when none of
                  Amanda's jewelry went missing on their first home visit - an infamous
                  sign of doom in the Astey household.</p>

                  <p class="paragraph-text party">Keep your eyes on Mckenzie during the
                  wedding reception. That girl can moooove.</p>

                  <p class="paragraph-text party">One day, Amanda received an email from
                  Caleb asking, "How much would someone have to pay you to break up with
                  me?" Amanda romantically replied,</p>

                  <p class="paragraph-text party">"I dunno. $15.34"</p>

                  <p class="paragraph-text party">The next day Eric showed up at the
                  apartment with $15.34 worth of candy. So, in all fairness, Eric owns
                  Amanda fair and square. We're lucky he's letting this wedding take
                  place.</p>

                  <p class="paragraph-text party">Eric was Caleb's officemate at Boeing
                  and the two developed a close relationship in their time together.
                  Caleb was consistently impressed by Eric's desire to learn. One week
                  Eric would talk about gardening, the next week Parkour... there was
                  always something new. He has also become Caleb and Amanda's favorite
                  theater buddy as he is a great appreciator of the arts.</p>

                  <p class="paragraph-text party">We just hope he doesn't raise any
                  objections at the wedding...</p>

                  <p class="right-party-sub">Groomsmaid</p>

                  <p class="paragraph-text party">When Caleb and Kristine met several
                  years ago they instantly bonded over their love of music. They have
                  worked together in several bands, most recently "All the Best Kids,'
                  and they still love an evening of busking out in Dupont.</p>

                  <p class="paragraph-text party">Kristine is often considered a mentor
                  of the friend group as she is always willing to listen and lend advice
                  to a party in need. She is also the only one who can keep a room full
                  of rowdy musicians in line. And we can't even mention her Christmas
                  cards without tearing up...</p>

                  <p class="paragraph-text party">However, this reputation doesn't take
                  into account KT's infamous parties or her rockstar persona on the
                  stage. Nor does it embody her dancing talents or ability to make a mean
                  quiche. Kristine is pretty much a one stop shop for music, fun, and
                  deliciousness.</p>

                  <p class="paragraph-text party">Caleb and Jared lived together for
                  years before Amanda came into the picture. Together the roommates
                  dominated the Arlington social scene with their good looks and
                  ridiculous behavior. Any night they went out on the town turned into an
                  outrageous adventure.</p>

                  <p class="paragraph-text party">Jared is, without a doubt, the best
                  story teller that Caleb and Amanda have come across. He can make a
                  night watching cheesy chick flicks sound like the most fun a person can
                  have. And, let's be honest, if you're watching chick flicks with Jared,
                  you're probably having a stellar time.</p>

                  <p class="paragraph-text party">When Caleb and Amanda moved in together
                  they had some trouble adjusting to their Jared-less abode. Returning
                  home after a late night at the bars is never as much fun without a
                  Jared dance party.</p>
