<h1 class="section-header">Our Families</h1>
<p>Ashley and Dan are incredibly grateful to their families and friends for making this wedding possible. Ashley’s parents, John Houghton and Janet Loneragan, and Dan’s dad, Andrew Remer, have been instrumental in making this weekend happen and have always provided the utmost love and support to their children. We cannot wait to make them in-laws.</p>
<p>Ashley is fortunate to be surrounded by a community of women who are driven, thoughtful, kind, and excellent listeners. She has begun to call them “the Council”, because their expertise and insights have been invaluable in this process. Keep an eye out for Amanda Astey, Claire Sale, Sultana Khan, Kristine Teets, Michelle Mathy, and Emily Lilja. They are all stunning, amazing human beings. She’s also the lucky older sister to Grant, who lives in Australia with spiders and drop bears and other dangerous creatures. She is, like Dan, is overwhelmed with love for the many, many people who have strengthened her relationship with her soon-to-be husband.</p>
<p>For family and friends that have been around to see Ashley and Dan become each others significant others, Dan wants you to know that you all made this wedding happen. He means this both literally and figuratively. Your support, advice, and quality time was invaluable to Ashley and Dan being a successful merger. Thank you so much to all of you for being part of his life and helping shape Dan into the awe inspiring, role model that he is today.  Without you, Ashley may have ended up marrying someone much more qualified.</p>
