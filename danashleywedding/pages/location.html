    <p>Camp Puh’Tok is a summer camp located <strong>half an hour north of Baltimore </strong>that offers 67 acres of pristine woodlands to explore, as well as unique gathering, meeting, lodging and dining spaces.* </p>
    <p>Camp Puh'tok's cabins accommodate up to 120 guests and you can expect to share a cabin with roughly 7 or more guests. Note that <strong>cell phone reception is spotty</strong> and <strong>Internet is unavailable </strong>at Camp Puh’Tok. </p>
    <p>Directions: From Baltimore, take I-83 North to exit 27, 137/ Mt. Carmel Road towards Hereford. Take a right on 137 East Mt. Carmel Road after the exit, then take a right on 45 South after half a mile. Take your very first left on 138 East, and then stay to the left to take Big Falls Road. Stay on Big Falls Road for another half mile until you see a sign on the right for Camp Puh’Tok. Turn right to take the access road to the camp, and then drive in between the two wooden bears to get to Thunderbird Lodge.</p>
    <p>*Fun fact: Camp Puh’Tok was the film location of “Camp David” in the Netflix hit television show House of Cards. (Be warned that it looks nothing like Camp David. I mean, we don’t know, we’ve never been to Camp David, but it definitely looks more like a summer camp than a resort.)</p>
