    <h1 class="section-header">Packing</h1>
    <h2>If you’re staying in a cabin:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Linens: bringing sheets or a sleeping bag and a pillow will be key if you would like to stay in the cabins.</li>
        <li>Towel</li>
        <li>Pajamas</li>
        <li>Toiletries and toilet paper will be provided by the couple, but be sure to bring anything beyond soap/shampoo/conditioner/toothpaste that you like. Blow dryers, hair gel, toothbrushes, etc.</li>
        <li>Everything from the next two lists…</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>If you’re staying at the camp during the day, but sleeping elsewhere:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Outdoor-friendly clothes. Stuff that won't mind trekking around camp. Jeans, t-shirts, shorts, a hoodie... Whatever you're comfortable in.</li>
        <li>Warm clothes. We expect the weather to be warm but it could get chilly in the evening.</li>
        <li>Footwear that you can hike/run in.</li>
        <li>A rain jacket/mud boots/umbrella – just in case!</li>
        <li>Flashlight</li>
        <li>Bug spray: hopefully won't be too buggy and we'll have some backup but if your bug spray needs are significant, it would be a good idea to bring your favorite brand.</li>
        <li>Sunscreen: If you’re closely related to Dan or Ashley, you probably should bring some sunscreen. Our pale complexions give new meaning to the term “white wedding”.</li>
        <li>Camera </li>
        <li>Water bottle. Stay hydrated. Our goal is to make this a faint-free wedding.</li>
        <li>Something awesome to wear on your head for the Friday night dinner (see “Schedule” to learn more)</li>
        <li>What makes you most happy: bring a guitar, banjo, recorder, hula-hoop, Frisbee, yoga mat, board games, kick balls, lawn games – anything you’d like to share! It will likely be too cold for a dip in the pool, but if you’d like to bring anything to camp, bring it!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>If you will join us on Saturday solely for the wedding ceremony and reception (starting at 5pm):</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The wedding will be dressy casual (what Ashley’s playfully calling ”Campground Formal”) attire with our suggestion that you prepare for an outdoor wedding in the shade (layers, no stiletto shoes). Ashley will be wearing white, but she won’t be offended if you also wear the same or a similar color.</li>
    </ul>
