    <h2>Stay at camp:</h2>
    <p>If you're comfortable sleeping in group cabins, stay with us on site! The facilities are pretty darn nice for a camp, but certainly basic. No cost, but some important notes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You'll likely be sharing a cabin with between 7-12 other guests. We'll be thoughtfully engineering the cabin groups but appreciate your flexibility.</li>
        <li>Cabins are heated and have air conditioning. They also have bathrooms with warm water and decent showers, but you will want to bring towels.</li>
        <li>The beds are the nicest we've seen at a summer camp, but they are summer camp bunks -- you'll need to bring or borrow sheets or a sleeping bag (see the “Packing” page for more)</li>
        <li>Also feel free to “crash” with us on Saturday night if you do not feel comfortable driving home after the wedding reception. We will have beds ready for just that purpose!</li>
        <li>We'll ask each person staying in a cabin to do some basic cleanup on Sunday, just to make sure we leave the camp the way we found it.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Bring a tent to the camp: </h2>
    <p>If this all sounds too civilized -- or if you'd like to stay on site but want a little more privacy than sharing a cabin with a dozen of Ashley and Dan's friends would afford -- you can instead pitch a tent on one of Puh'tok's tent fields and share a cabin's restroom and storage space.</p>
    <h2>Stay at a hotel:</h2>
    <p> For those who would prefer private accommodations, we suggest making reservations at the <a href=" http://embassysuites3.hilton.com/en/hotels/maryland/embassy-suites-by-hilton-baltimore-hunt-valley-BALHVES/index.html">Embassy Suites Hunt Valley </a>or the <a href="http://www.huntvalleywyndhamgrand.com/" />Hunt Valley Inn</a>. We have not put a block on the hotels, so we encourage you to reserve a room sooner rather than later if you think you might be able to join us! Both hotels are a 15-20 minute drive from camp.</p>
    <p>If you stay at a hotel, we still hope you'll treat Camp Puh'tok as home base – you are welcome to spend as much time at the camp as you like!</p>
