    <p>Your company is the greatest gift you could provide to our wedding. We are lucky to have lived together for a few years and need very little, particularly in our small apartment on the west coast.</p>
    <p>For our alternative gift registry, please click <a href="http://www.sokindregistry.org/registry/6748" >here</a>. </p>
    <p>If you would like to contribute your talent and abilities to the wedding, rather than physical or monetary gifts, please tell us (DremWedding@gmail.com) what would make your soul hum! Some ideas:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Playing music during the cocktail hour</li>
        <li>Leading a yoga/tai chi/meditation session Saturday morning</li>
        <li>Helping wrangle children on Friday or Saturday night</li>
        <li>Building a campfire on Friday or Saturday night (we will provide the wood, matches, newspaper and sâ€™mores!)</li>
        <li>Creating a wedding bouquet for Ashley</li>
        <li>Building a wedding chuppah for the couple</li>
        <li>Anything else you would enjoy!</li>
    </ul>
