    <h1 class="section-header">We can’t wait for you to join us for our wedding weekend:</h1>
    <p>We plan to exchange our vows <strong>Saturday, May 21, at 5:00pm</strong>, followed by dinner, dancing, and a bonfire. That said, you are invited to join us from <strong>Friday through Sunday</strong> on site at Camp Puh’Tok, a working summer camp in Monkton, MD. Camp Puh’Tok provides basic, dormitory-style sleeping arrangements, or feel free to stay locally and drive in for the daytime events. If you can only attend Saturday, no worries. We’ll be excited to see you no matter what!</p>
    <p><strong>While the wedding will be “dressy casual” attire</strong>, the rest of the weekend is summer camp-themed. So wear your jeans and sneakers and prepare to enjoy the woods! </p>
    <p><strong>Bring what makes you happy, from board games to hula-hoops to guitars</strong>. After all, we have a whole weekend to play together. See more in the “Packing” tab.</p>
    <p>More than anything, we’re excited to bring our respective tribes together and celebrate our union with you. See you in May!</p>
