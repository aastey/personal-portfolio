    <h1 class="section-header">Ashley and Dan</h1>
    <p>Ashley and Dan met four years ago in Arlington, Virginia at Ashley’s friends Amanda and Caleb’s housewarming party (you’ll meet them at the wedding, they’re great). Dan had also recently moved to the same apartment complex and, after some convincing from his friends (thanks, Ryan and Tim!), decided to visit his new neighbors and welcome them to the building. Dan and Ashley were a quick match: Ashley loved Dan’s wry sense of humor and excellent taste in movies, and Dan loved Ashley’s mom jeans. (Just kidding, he hated those jeans, but he loved her anyway.) </p>

            <p><strong>Ashley, on Dan:</strong> “He’s handsome and playful and charming, but he’s also really thoughtful and calm and reliable and honest. He’s incredible with his words. He’s a courageous teacher. He’s a terrific dancer. He’s always saying yes to adventures, whether it’s moving to Oakland or taking lindy hop lessons or planning a weekend-long wedding in the woods. He is a partner in every sense, and someone I want to be there when life is beautiful and tough and everything in between.” </p>

            <p><strong>Dan, on Ashley:</strong> “She laughs at my poor attempts at wit and cracks me up with her dry repartee. Her tireless compassion, empathy and drive to do good are an inspiration. She approaches life with courageousness and honesty, which I greatly admire. Ashley pushes me to stretch myself and exercise my humanity, which helps me to grow into a better person every day. She also makes a mean mushroom risotto.”</p>
